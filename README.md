## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Choices

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18 with TypeScript**: Provides type safety and modern React features like concurrent rendering
- **Vite**: Fast build tool for better development experience and optimized production builds
- **React Router v6**: Modern routing solution with data loading and nested routes support

### State Management
- **React Query (TanStack Query)**: For server state management and caching (prepared for future API integration)
- **Local State**: Using React hooks for component-level state management
- **Mock Data**: Currently using local mock data structure that mirrors expected API responses

### UI/UX Design System
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling
- **Shadcn/ui**: High-quality, accessible component library built on Radix UI
- **Design Tokens**: Semantic color system using CSS custom properties for consistent theming

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoints at sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)

### Authentication Strategy
- **Mock Authentication**: Simple localStorage-based auth for demonstration
- **Route Protection**: Guards for authenticated routes using React Router
- **User Session**: Persistent login state across browser sessions

### Component Structure
